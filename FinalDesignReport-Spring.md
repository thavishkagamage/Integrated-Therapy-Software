## Project Description

### Abstract

TheraThrive is a web-based therapy application that delivers personalized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions using artificial intelligence. TheraThrive combats the global challenge of depression, affecting 280 million people. Leveraging existing large language models, TheraThrive enhances accessibility to mental health treatment, free of financial barriers and scheduling constraints. 

### Full Description

Major Depressive Disorder is a serious mental health condition that affects approximately 280 million people globally. Depression is characterized by long-lasting feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in everyday activities. Arising from a mix of biological, psychological, environmental, and social factors, depression leaves patients lacking motivation to do everyday activities and withdrawing from the people close to them.

The rising demand for mental health care has outpaced the supply of professionals. Digital software-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) solutions have emerged to fill this gap by offering affordable, always-available support. However, they lack the real-life connections that are crucial for overcoming depression, highlighting the need for an integrated approach, one that combines CBT with social support and accountability.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a structured, goal-oriented approach that focuses on the present to change negative thought patterns and behaviors. CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all deeply connected. CBT works through all three by enabling therapists and clients to work together to identify, challenge, and replace negative automatic thoughts and behaviors through strategic growth experiences.

TheraThrive Integrated Therapy Software combines the benefits of computerized CBT with social support. Users log in to a convenient website to chat with an AI-powered assistant for weekly hour-long therapy sessions. The chatbot uses a structured agenda, agenda-item specific prompts, and tools to provide effective therapy and relationship building support, enabling the treatment of depression from both a psychological and social dimension.

### CS Members: 

**Richard:** I developed a large amount of the conversation logic in the backend that guides the user through the conversation agenda. I wrote the tools to switch agenda items and update the conversation status as well as building the crisis mode. I also helped with a lot of the overall frontend conversation design and development. I tested all of these features that use the LLM API manually.
