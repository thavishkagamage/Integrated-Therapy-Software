## Start Your First Chat

Once signed in, you can select the chat window from the header to start a CBT conversation. From there, you will have two options: an unstructured free chat or a CBT session.

### Free Chat

Free chat is an all purpose mental health therapy chat that adheres to the same guidelines as our CBT sessions. This chat is designed to have no agenda, allowing the user to discuss any therapy-related topic they want, includng asking questions about the CBT process. 

### CBT Sessions

All of our CBT sessions have a predefined agenda. The chatbot will take the user through the agenda items one-by-one in the order it sees as the most appropriate. Within each agenda item, the chatbot has multiple topics it will work through with the user before moving on. The overall session progress can be seen outside of the chat window to the right. The user is welcome to discuss anything therapy-related they would like, but the chatbot will attempt to guide the conversation back toward the agenda tasks when the discussion goes off topic.
