## **Project Sought**
The type of capstone that I am seeking is one that works with **Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML)**. This is the field that I plan to work in post-graduation and it is the area where I am working on my **master's thesis**.

The area that I am currently working in is **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, but this is not the only AI/ML field that interests me. I have a couple of ideas for **LLM projects** that I am discussing with a small group of people to possibly work on.
